# ✨ pi-statusline — A Beautiful, Practical Footer for Pi

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@narumitw/pi-statusline)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@narumitw/pi-statusline) [![Pi extension](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pi-extension-blue)](https://pi.dev) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](./LICENSE)

`@narumitw/pi-statusline` gives [Pi](https://pi.dev) an opinionated powerline footer that looks good
without setup and keeps useful context visible as the terminal narrows.

A representative uncolored layout:

```text
░▒▓ 🤖 sonnet-4 🧠 high 📁 pi-extensions 🌿 main ~2 🪟 ctx 42.0%/200k 🕒 16:42
```

## ✨ Features

- **Zero-config default:** model, thinking, workspace, Git/PR state, context use, and local time.
- **Responsive:** removes lower-priority segments before important information gets clipped.
- **Quiet when idle:** activity appears only while Pi is streaming or running tools.
- **Native-aligned usage:** optional token, prompt-cache, subscription, and cost details.
- **Easy choices:** three information levels and seven previewable color presets.
- **Still flexible:** custom layouts, multiline rows, colors, labels, separators, and status icons stay
  available under **Advanced**.

> **Need more customization?** See
> [`pi-starship`](https://github.com/narumiruna/pi-extensions/tree/main/extensions/pi-starship)
> ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@narumitw/pi-starship)). It uses a
> [Starship-inspired](https://starship.rs/) TOML format and style syntax for deeper control over
> layout, modules, and colors. Choose `pi-statusline` for practical defaults and quick setup.
>
> Do not enable both extensions at the same time because both own Pi's footer.

## 📦 Install

```bash
pi install npm:@narumitw/pi-statusline
```

Try it without installing, or load it from this repository:

```bash
pi -e npm:@narumitw/pi-statusline
pi -e ./extensions/pi-statusline
```

For the best result, use a terminal font that includes Powerline glyphs and emoji.

## 🚀 Quick start

1. Install the extension and start Pi.
2. Run `/statusline`.
3. Use the standard Main/Advanced navigation, then choose an appearance or information level;
   specialized previews still apply changes immediately.

```text
Appearance (tokyo-night)
Information (balanced)
Advanced
Status
Help
```

| Menu item | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Appearance** | Preview palettes with Up/Down; Enter applies and Escape cancels |
| **Information** | Preview and apply a curated set of segments |
| **Advanced** | Open Custom layout or Edit settings JSON |
| **Status** | Show the effective source, path, appearance, layout, and diagnostics |
| **Help** | Show command and schema guidance |

### Information levels

Selecting a level replaces only the `segments` array. Unknown and unrelated JSON fields are
preserved.

| Level | Included segments |
| --- | --- |
| **Minimal** | `model cwd branch context` |
| **Balanced** (default) | `model thinking cwd branch tools context time` |
| **Detailed** | `provider model thinking cwd branch tools context tokens cache cost time` |
| **Custom** | Any other segment order, including explicit line breaks |

The `tools` segment takes no space while idle. `cache` takes no space when Pi has reported no cache
reads or writes.

## 💬 Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/statusline` | Open Appearance, Information, Advanced, Status, and Help |
| `/statusline settings` | Open the JSON editor in TUI mode |
| `/statusline status` | Show the effective settings and diagnostics |
| `/statusline help` | Show command and schema guidance |

The direct `settings`, `status`, and `help` routes remain for compatibility. The root standard menu
is TUI-only; Escape returns from Advanced or closes Main. RPC receives observable notifications
instead of TUI-only controls. Unknown subcommands and trailing arguments are rejected. Palette and
information previews, the width-aware layout editor, and the JSON editor remain specialized UI
because they provide live preview/edit behavior rather than standard navigation.

## 📐 Runtime behavior

### Responsive fitting

Each row keeps its configured segment order. If it is too wide, pi-statusline removes the
lowest-priority segment, recomputes the powerline transitions, and repeats until the row fits.
Retention priority is highest to lowest:

```text
context model branch tools cwd thinking cost provider cache tokens time turn brand
```

Explicit `line_break` entries remain row boundaries. A single segment that is still too wide is
ANSI-safely truncated.

### Activity, Git, and PR state

- During active work, `tools` shows `💭 thinking` or `⚙ <tool>` with parallel counts.
- Activity disappears after the agent settles and resets across session replacement or shutdown.
- Clean repositories show no Git counters.
- Dirty counters are `⇡` ahead, `⇣` behind, `+` staged, `~` modified/deleted, `?` untracked, and `!`
  conflicts.
- A linked GitHub PR appears with the branch when possible, avoiding a duplicate extension status.
- Context color changes to warning at 70% and error at 90%.
- Git state is cached outside footer rendering and stale session results are ignored.

### Usage and context

- `context` renders one-decimal current usage and the model window, such as `2.4%/272k`. After
  compaction it can temporarily render `?/272k` until the next valid assistant response.
- `tokens`, `cache`, and `cost` total every usage-bearing session entry, matching Pi's native footer:
  assistant messages, nested-LLM tool results, compactions, and branch summaries, including abandoned
  branches retained in the session.
- Cache tokens are `R<read>`, `W<write>`, and `CH<rate>`. `R` and `W` are cumulative; `CH` uses only
  the latest assistant prompt: `cacheRead / (input + cacheRead + cacheWrite) * 100`.
- Subscription-backed OAuth models and `kimi-coding` append `(sub)` to cost. The dollar value is
  usage cost, not proof of an amount billed under a subscription.
- Pi's public extension API does not expose the current auto-compaction toggle, so this footer cannot
  reliably show the native `(auto)` marker.

## ⚙️ Settings

The extension uses one user-level file:

```text
<getAgentDir()>/pi-statusline.json
```

There are no project or environment overrides. When the file is absent, pi-statusline uses its
built-in defaults without creating the file or parent directory. The first successful settings save
creates a complete editable document atomically. Malformed or unreadable settings are never
overwritten. Settings reload on startup, `/reload`, and session replacement.

A valid legacy `pi-statusline-settings.json` remains readable with a warning and is never modified
automatically; rename it to `pi-statusline.json`. If both files exist, `pi-statusline.json` wins.

### Settings reference

| Field | Accepted values | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `palettePreset` | `tokyo-night`, `ocean`, `sunset`, `forest`, `candy`, `neon`, `mono`, `custom` | Select the active color preset |
| `palette` | Per-segment `fg`/`bg` `#RRGGBB` colors | Define colors used by `custom` |
| `density` | `compact`, `cozy` | Control horizontal padding |
| `separator` | `none`, `dot`, `bar`, `powerline`, `round` | Separate adjacent segments in one color block |
| `segments` | Ordered unique segment names and `line_break` | Control visibility, order, and rows |
| `segmentText` | Per-segment `prefix` and `suffix`; model truncation fields | Format Pi-owned dynamic values |
| `extensionStatusIcons` | Raw status key or `namespace:*` to icon string | Customize extension status icons |
| `stackExtensionStatuses` | Boolean, default `false` | Render each extension status on its own footer row instead of wrapping them together |
| `maxExtensionStatuses` | Integer 1 through 50, default `5` | Limit the number of visible extension statuses |

All fields are optional in an existing document. Missing fields use defaults. Unknown fields produce a
warning but are preserved by menu saves. Invalid recognized values block saving, leaving the previous
file and live footer unchanged.

A compact customization example:

```json
{
  "palettePreset": "ocean",
  "density": "compact",
  "separator": "dot",
  "segments": ["model", "thinking", "cwd", "branch", "context", "cache", "cost"],
  "segmentText": {
    "model": {
      "truncationLength": 40,
      "truncationSymbol": "…",
      "truncationDirection": "middle"
    },
    "context": { "prefix": "ctx ", "suffix": "" }
  },
  "extensionStatusIcons": {
    "goal": "◎",
    "foo:*": "🧪"
  },
  "stackExtensionStatuses": true,
  "maxExtensionStatuses": 8
}
```

Use **Advanced → Edit settings JSON** or `/statusline settings` to edit, validate, atomically save, and
apply the file.

## 🎨 Appearance

Named palettes provide contrast-checked color ramps. Appearance previews update while the picker
moves, but save only when Enter is pressed; Escape restores the saved palette.

When `palettePreset` is `custom`, `palette` maps segment names to foreground/background colors:

```json
{
  "palettePreset": "custom",
  "palette": {
    "model": { "fg": "#090c0c", "bg": "#a3aed2" },
    "context": { "fg": "#c0caf5", "bg": "#1d2230" }
  }
}
```

- Selecting `custom` without a palette copies the active named preset as a starting point.
- A manually authored `"palettePreset": "custom"` without `palette` uses Tokyo Night colors.
- Named presets ignore but preserve an existing custom palette.
- A `palette` object without `palettePreset` selects `custom`.
- Legacy string palettes such as `"palette": "ocean"` remain accepted.
- Missing custom colors remain unstyled instead of inheriting Tokyo Night.
- Adjacent segments with identical colors share one block; transitions use ``.

`segmentText` values must be single-line text without terminal control characters. Use `line_break`
for another row rather than inserting a newline into a prefix or suffix.

### Model truncation

Long model IDs are truncated out of the box so the balanced footer can retain useful model context:

```json
{
  "segmentText": {
    "model": {
      "truncationLength": 36,
      "truncationSymbol": "…",
      "truncationDirection": "start"
    }
  }
}
```

`truncationLength` counts model grapheme clusters retained before the symbol. The built-in value is
`36`; set it to `0` to display the complete ID. The direction names the removed portion:

- `start` retains the suffix and is the default, which is useful for long llama.cpp paths and model
  variants.
- `middle` retains both ends.
- `end` retains the prefix.

Truncation runs after the built-in Claude/GPT shortening rules but before the configured model prefix
and suffix. It changes display only—the provider model ID is untouched. Terminal control sequences
in model IDs are removed at render time, and unsafe configured symbols are rejected. An empty
`truncationSymbol` truncates without a marker. pi-statusline treats model IDs as opaque strings and
does not parse paths, repositories, GGUF suffixes, or quantization names. At very narrow widths, the
existing responsive priorities may still omit the model rather than overflow the terminal.

## 🧩 Advanced layout

Open **Advanced → Custom layout** when the curated levels are not enough.

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Up/Down | Navigate |
| Page Up/Page Down | Move by one viewport |
| Enter/Space | Show or hide the selected segment |
| `M` | Enter or leave Move mode |
| Up/Down in Move mode | Reorder the selected visible segment |
| `Alt+Up` / `Alt+Down` | Reorder without entering Move mode |
| `B` | Add or remove a line break after the selected segment |
| Escape | Leave Move mode first, then close the screen |

Every successful change saves and applies immediately; closing the screen does not roll it back.

Available data segments:

```text
brand provider model thinking cwd branch tools context tokens cache cost time turn
```

Data segments must be unique. `line_break` may repeat when data segments separate occurrences, but
consecutive breaks are invalid. It has no `segmentText` entry. The menu cleans up leading, trailing,
and newly consecutive breaks after visibility changes. Manually authored leading/trailing breaks
represent empty rows.

```json
{
  "segments": ["model", "line_break", "cwd", "branch", "context"]
}
```

An empty `segments` array hides the main powerline while extension statuses can still render. The
extension intentionally has no variable or format language; use `pi-starship` when you need one.

## 🔌 Extension statuses and icons

Other extension statuses appear below the main powerline, wrap to terminal width, and are limited to
five items. Icons resolve in this order:

1. Exact configured raw key, such as `goal` or `foo:server`.
2. Longest configured colon wildcard, such as `foo:*` or `foo:server:*`.
3. Unambiguous installed-package alias, such as `@vendor/pi-foo`, `pi-foo`, or `foo`.
4. Leading emoji supplied by the status text.
5. Built-in icon.
6. Generic `🔌` fallback.

Set an icon to `""` to hide only the icon. Wildcards match colon namespaces, not slash-delimited keys;
configure slash keys exactly. Compatibility fallbacks retain `codex-usage`, `pisync`, and
`unknown-error-retry`; an explicit canonical key wins.

For interoperable extensions, prefer one aggregated key or a stable coexistence slot:

```text
<extension-id>
<extension-id>:<stable-slot>
```

Put transient activity in the value and always clear the same complete key.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **Powerline symbols look wrong:** use a font with Powerline glyphs; emoji support is also recommended.
- **The footer reports settings warnings:** run `/statusline status`, then `/statusline settings` to fix
  invalid recognized fields.
- **The footer appears to be replaced:** disable `pi-starship` or another extension that also calls
  Pi's `setFooter()`.
- **A custom segment disappears on a narrow terminal:** check the responsive priority above or add an
  explicit `line_break`.
